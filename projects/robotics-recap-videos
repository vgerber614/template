summary: While I was in the FIRST Robotics club in high school, I made a video each week in which I recorded the team's progress and interviewed members.

I had a lot of fun editting videos throughout high school. Some of my favorite video making memories were made while working as a business and graphics member of the FIRST Robotics Club. I learned a lot about not only editting videos, but the behind the scene work behind the club and the roles of each team member.

## FIRST: For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology - What is it?

The FIRST Robotics Competition is an international competition where high school teams build robots to compete against and work with other teams in accomplishing tasks as part of the a robot game. Each year there is a themed competition with different tasks to earn points. Teams have a six week "build season" to ready a robot for competition.

## The Business and Graphics Subteam

Many teams, including my high school's team, divide work into subteams. We had an electrical, mechanical, and business & graphics subteam. I was a part of the buisness & graphics subteam. We were in charge of promoting the team, gathering sponsors, and designing things like club shirts and buttons.

As a member of the business & graphics subteam, I specialized in making weekly videos updating the groups progress within the build season. This was a way for sponsors and supporters to get updated, for other teams to see our robot, and for the group to reflect on what they have done. To make these videos, I filmed and photographed the team throughout the week then interviewed selected members for an interview. I then editted it all together into the recap video for that work.

## What I Learned

While I learned a lot about video editting, I also learned valuable life skills such as communication and time managament. Also, I got to learn a lot about what the other subteams, which, unexpectedly made me want to look into their focuses. Seeing the process behind making the robot contributed a lot to may interest in computer science and technology. Even though I was a member of the business & graphics subteam, this experience played a major part in my current aspirations as a computer science major.


The videos I made from weeks 1-4 are posted on the [Mililani High School FIRST Robotics youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKUNAIHfXGYSQ8OW1hS0PJw/videos) (see year 2017).
