The term "Waggle" refers to dance that honey bees perform to help find food. My group, "The Hive Manoa", came up with a web application called "Waggle". In this web application, UH Manoa students act as bees working to collect as much honey as they can. They earn this honey by joining and creating course related study sessions. Those who collect the most honey can see their names at the top of the leaderboard!

## My Role


## What I Learned

I learned valuable leadership skills such as coordinating lesson plans, communicating with other, and managing time. Most importantly, I got to further see the value of STEM education and it felt great to be able to share something I am passionate about to young curious minds. Being able to help run this STEM camp and expose kids to things like programming, the language of our future, was a proud moment for me because I knew I was making a real difference and can continue to make a difference.

The Hawaii Department of Education wrote about the camp in [this article](www.hawaiipublicschools.org/VisionForSuccess/SuccessStories/Students/Pages/MililaniSTEMCamp.aspx
)!
