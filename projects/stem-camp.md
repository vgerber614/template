## A Student Run STEM Camp
In high school, I was a member of the Science club as wel as the Robotics CLub. Together they hosted the Mililani STEM Camp, offered to kids grades 3-5. At the camp, kids worked with LEGO robotics, programming, and various science exploratory topics. I coordinated a few lesson plans, conducting activities such as building a paper rollercoaster, understanding sound waves, and using a compass and directions to find treasure. My favorite parts, however, was being able to expose kids to their first lines of code!

I've always wished I was exposed to programming at a younger age. I hadn't really been exposed to it until high school. I think anyone can learn to code, and these kids were no exception. They did a great job handling the challenges on [Hour Of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us) and by the end of the week long course, they were able to make their own fully functional games on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)!

Scratch is free a block-based visual programming language, great for learning the basics of code. I remember making my own first lines of code here and going home at night making fun(ny) games and animated stories. It is a great way for people to see how fun programming can be and how simple it can be for anyone to pick up on.

Considering these were kids from grades 3-5, there was definitely a lot of critical thinking they had to adapt to. I did everything I could to help break down problems and get them thinkng of creative solutions. They were being challenged; however, we were able to get them through it all and make pretty elaborate programs.

## What I Learned

I learned valuable leadership skills such as coordinating lesson plans, communicating with other, and managing time. Most importantly, I got to further see the value of STEM education and it felt great to be able to share something I am passionate about to young curious minds. Being able to help run this STEM camp and expose kids to things like programming, the language of our future, was a proud moment for me because I knew I was making a real difference and can continue to make a difference.
