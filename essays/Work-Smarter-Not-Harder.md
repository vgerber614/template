## No Calculators Allowed!

Remember that math class you had where you were never allowed to use a calculator?  And then you had to squeeze all your written calculations in the margins and HOPE you remembered to carry the one. It might have even pulled your focus away from the main concepts you were supposed to be learning because you were too busy drowning in calculations.

A calculator can help you complete more work in a much faster amount of time. When it comes to programming, being efficent is key. If you're constantly trying to reinvent the wheel you'll never build a car.


## Building Blocks of Code

When writing code, its common to use material and resources that is already out there. You build your application based on solutions to common problems that have been done before. Programmers can follow a "Design Pattern" to make sure their code runs a solution that has already been solved before. Working smarter by using your resources so you can efficiently build bigger things. Be innovative with the tools around you!
