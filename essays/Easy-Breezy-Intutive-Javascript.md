## First impressions
Last week I was introduced to Javascript with just Java, c++, and Python under my belt of programming languages. Learning just the basics, my first impression was "wow, this is almost just like Java" (more so than python or c++ at least). Thus, I found it really easy to pick up on and learn the basics. 

## Javascript is easier and more intutitive
Overall, I think Javascript brings up a great deal of strengths as a programming language. I learned that the language is based off more abstract ideas of computation compared to other languages like C++ and Java. This is why Javascript is simpler and more intutive. Despite its abstraction, Javascript is powerful enough to perform big and complex tasks important. It is the largest and fastest growing language by far due to its applicability in just about every area of computer science. Thus, it is essential to furthering a career in the field. 

## Learning along the way
Despite having some prior experience in programming, I did learn new things I found valuable to programming in general. This included lessons on "let" vs "const" and "for-of" vs "for-in". These are terms that can easily get mixed up, so I'm glad I recieved clarification on these concepts now so I can judge which is best fit for my programming in the futuree.
I also found creating an object class in Javascript to be maybe the most differentating thing from Java so far.

## Athletic software engineering
In class we learn through "WODs". These are weekly assignments to practice programming which I found to be very helpful. I think WODs will help me to keep thinking like a programmer and improve the efficiency of my programming skills. I like that we are provided with finish times to help us gauge how we are doing so I can see what I need to practice more.
So far, the WODs seem simple enough considering we are just dipping our feet back into basic level programming; however, I imagine it will get harder along the way. Given the number of practices we are given and the room for self improvement along the way, I think it is an overall efficient way to improve our programming skills. Any difficulties will surely be worth it and - as a self directed learner and competitive goal setter - I anticiapte this style of learning to be a fun challege.
